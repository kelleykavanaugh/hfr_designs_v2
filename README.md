Hello!

I created a Wordpress theme from scratch for the HFR Designs (www.hfrdesigns.com). This github repo contains that Wordpress theme. It was not created to be "out of the box" used by anyone else, but if you want to check it out, or modify it for your own use, that's okay by me. 

If you do, please:

1. Change the logo image to something you own.

2. Please leave my credit in the footer

3. Let me know where you've used it! I'd love to see your work. kelleykavanaugh@gmail.com

Some "features" of this theme (current version):

~ Powered with Bootstrap to be fully scalable!

~ Page Template "designs" uses the Wordpress Etsy Widget (http://sv-timemachine.net/2010/01/wordpress-etsy-widget/) to pull etsy information.

Please let me know if you use my Wordpress theme, or if you need help with anything on it! kelleykavanaugh@gmail.com

Thanks,

Kelley Kavanaugh
